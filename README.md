# Multi-Armed-Bandit-Algorithm-Simulation
This repository contains a Python implementation of the multi-armed bandit algorithm using an epsilon-greedy strategy. The project demonstrates the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning through a simulation with different epsilon values.
