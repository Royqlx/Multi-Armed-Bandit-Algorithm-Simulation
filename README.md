# Multi-Armed Bandit Algorithm Simulation

This repository contains a Python implementation of the multi-armed bandit algorithm using an epsilon-greedy strategy. The project demonstrates the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning through a simulation with different epsilon values.

## Description

The multi-armed bandit problem is a classic example of the exploration-exploitation dilemma in reinforcement learning. An agent has to choose between multiple actions (arms), each providing a stochastic reward. The goal is to maximize the cumulative reward over a series of steps. The epsilon-greedy strategy is used to balance exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (choosing the best-known action).

This project visualizes the performance of the epsilon-greedy strategy with different epsilon values.
